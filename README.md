# MineSweeper-solver

There are two main folders:
- MineSweep Solver - Printing statements: Prints the type of solver it uses and if the puzzle is solved, after the solver is finished it will print the flagged mines coordinates
- MineSweep Solver - No Printing statements: Does not print anything during solving, after the solver is finished it will print the flagged mines coordinates

Note: Both folders use the same solver, the difference is just in printing statements.

Both folders contain 3 files:
- Main.py: This is the main file where three variables have to be filled: the width and height of the grid, and the number of bombs.
- MineField.py: This is the MineField class provided by the developers of the coding challenge
- Solver.py: This is the solver class, where 3 different solvers are used to solve the game.

Main.py can be run to obtain the desired results

NOTE: I was not sure how to display the final answer, wheter it is should be returned or printed. At the moment it is printed.
      Furthermore, I did everything in Spyder where the script works fine, I don't know about other IDEs.
